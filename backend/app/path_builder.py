"""Personalized Learning Path builder — deterministic ordering (Phase 3).

Turns a completed topic-level diagnostic into an ordered, personalized path of
topics the student needs to improve, skipping mastered topics. Pure and
deterministic: ordering never depends on an LLM arbitrarily picking order.

Rules (see requirements):
  - mastered topics are skipped (never added as normal learning items)
  - weak topics come before developing topics (status priority)
  - within the same status, the skill blueprint's competency order is used as the
    prerequisite signal, then lower diagnostic score first
