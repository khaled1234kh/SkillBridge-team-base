"""Global Student AI Career Copilot — centralized, trusted context builder.

Only SAFE structured identifiers are accepted from the frontend
(``page``, ``skill_id``, ``competency``, ``job_title``, ``job_url``). Everything
the assistant needs — profile, readiness, verified skills, gaps, path, lesson,
job match, career roadmap — is re-resolved from backend state in this module,
so a student can never inject authoritative claims (scores, requirements,
verified status) from the client.

``page='assessment'`` is BLOCKED: the Tutor must never receive context while
the student is inside a verified final assessment. The tutor endpoint rejects
that request before any context is built.

# Mentor Experience Phase 1: the copilot choices ARE the four real SkillBridge
# mentors (nova / axel / sage / vex). There is no separate archetype layer —
# the old Navigator / Strategist / Confidant archetypes are gone from this
# module and never surface in onboarding or recommendation UI.
#
# All four mentors share the same underlying intelligence; their identity here
# is personality / communication / teaching style only (Phase 1 doesn't change
# mentor AI behavior). Each preset's behavior/style mirrors the mentor's
# canonical persona text (genai.TUTOR_PERSONAS) verbatim, so selecting a
# mentor in onboarding produces exactly the same composed AI persona the user
# already knows from chat — no intelligence change.
#
# Personality/capability is CONFIGURATION: the personality block below is
# composed into the dynamic system prompt at chat time (genai.tutor_reply
# ``personality`` override), so it is free to vary per user without touching
# the voice pool. The voice is a SCARCE resource (shared ElevenLabs agents) and
# is referenced, never duplicated, per copilot.
