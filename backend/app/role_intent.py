"""Shared career-intent resolution for SkillBridge (ESCO + live jobs).

One source of truth for turning a student's *selected Target Role* into a
canonical career intent that both the ESCO occupation search and the Dashboard
live-jobs feed obey. This keeps the two surfaces from independently guessing the
career from generic CV skill words.

Responsibilities (and only these -- no provider/HTTP logic):
  - normalise a target-role title (harmless spelling / lexical variants)
  - resolve trusted aliases / close family titles for a target
  - extract the *domain-bearing* tokens of a title (tokens that are NOT generic
    role tails like "analyst"/"manager"/"engineer")
  - classify a candidate title against the target:
        EXACT / CLOSE / FAMILY / UNRELATED
  - derive bounded provider query terms primarily from the target title + aliases
  - derive the role's canonical family key

The design is deliberately small and curated rather than a giant occupation
database: an alias/family layer for high-value, common equivalents, with the
rest left to generic token logic. Same mechanism works for cybersecurity,
design, finance, marketing, architecture, clinical research, legal, data,
software/AI, and any future role.
