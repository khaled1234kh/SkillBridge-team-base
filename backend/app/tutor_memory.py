"""Persona-specific conversation memory (Phase 2).

Each mentor keeps its OWN bounded conversation memory. Storage of the actual
messages stays in ``tutor_messages`` (already keyed by ``student_id`` +
``tutor_id``); this module adds a rolling, DETERMINISTIC digest of the older
messages that have dropped out of the bounded recent window, persisted in the
per-(student, mentor) ``tutor_conversation_memory`` row:

    summary           .. compact text the LLM sees instead of the full history
    last_compacted_id .. watermark id of the newest message already folded,
                         so compaction is idempotent and never rescans a tail

Everything here is conversation context ONLY — never authoritative SkillBridge
state. The memory carries the student's own chat claims verbatim (labelled as
claims) and can never create or override verified skills, assessment scores,
completion, readiness, CV evidence, or the target role. Trusted facts travel
only through the separate copilot context paths; on any conflict, trusted state
wins. Summary generation is fully deterministic and offline: a provider failure
or missing LLM can never break chat, and the bounded recent window always works
on its own.
