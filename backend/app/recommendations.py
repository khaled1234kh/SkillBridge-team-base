"""Universal Target-Role Recommendation engine (Phase B).

Domain-agnostic, evidence-based role ranking against a student's *trusted*
backend skill profile (self-reported + verified). Candidates come from three
sources:

1. company roles (non-reference rows) -- first-party labour-market signal,
2. SkillBridge catalog roles (``is_reference``) -- curated demo profiles,
3. ESCO occupations -- discovered from the student's most informative skills.

Ranking is role-relative and explainable:

- A required skill's weight is its inverse candidate frequency: rare,
  role-defining skills (Typography, Revit, Financial Modeling) weigh far more
  than generic transferable skills that appear across many roles (Communication,
  Teamwork, Excel) -- no hard-coded blacklist is needed.
- Level compatibility is applied only where SkillBridge stores a trusted
  required level (company + catalog roles). ESCO supplies no proficiency, so an
  ESCO match earns full credit for presence alone, never an invented level.
- A matched *verified* skill earns a small, bounded boost (constant factor), so
  a single verified skill can never dominate a recommendation.
- Roles with zero matched skills are omitted, so one unrelated skill cannot
  guess a career. Confidence labels are honest and non-prescriptive
  (Strong/Good/Possible match); recommendations are career *targets*, never
  eligibility or licensure claims.

The endpoint stays deterministic given a fixed profile: ESCO discovery is
supplementary -- if it fails, local recommendations are still returned with an
honest ``esco_status``.
