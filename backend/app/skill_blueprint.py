"""Skill Blueprint — the canonical statement of required competencies.

Two layers:
  1. TRUSTED blueprints: a small, manually-authored set of competency decompositions
     (Docker, Git, Machine Learning, SQL). These are authoritative, never regenerated
     by AI, and always used as-is.
  2. DERIVED blueprints: for any skill NOT in the trusted set, competencies are
     derived server-side via GenAI (validated) or a deterministic fallback, cached,
     versioned, and reused.  This makes the competency / diagnostic / coverage /
     learning path pipeline work for Typography, Market Research, Revit, Financial
     Modeling, Clinical Research, and any other open-universe skill.

Resolution order (every caller sees the same thing):
  has_blueprint(skill)  ->  True if trusted OR a blueprint could be derived
  required_competencies(skill, from, to)  ->  union of competencies across level range
  competency_names_for(skill, level)  ->  competencies for one specific level

Trusted blueprints are NEVER regenerated.  Derived blueprints are cached with a
version tag so changing the generation logic does not silently mutate historical
student progress.
