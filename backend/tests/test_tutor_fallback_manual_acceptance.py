"""Manual-acceptance regressions — target-role context gating in the tutor.

Reproduces the two October 2026 live Nova failures and locks the fixes:

  1. "Explain Docker volumes in a simple way." leaked the student's target role
     ("Clinical Research Assistant" came from the live student state, not from
     anything in the question) because the deterministic fallback built a career
     template for a GENERAL topic. GROUNDED topics must render role-free; a
     career-linked question is the ONLY case a fallback reply may name the role.
  2. "Give me another example of what you just explained." degraded to the
     generic limitation message. A deictic follow-up must resolve its topic from
     THIS mentor's conversation memory and produce a second, grounded example.
  3. The configured-but-unavailable NIM/NVIDIA path must show an honest
     "provider is connected but not answering" limitation -- never an invented
     career claim about the trusted role.

Also guards the PRECEDING WORK so this fix cannot regress it: Phase 1C general
context gating and Phase 2 per-mentor conversation-memory isolation.
