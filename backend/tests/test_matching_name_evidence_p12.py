"""P1-2 regression — Skill Gap Map / Career Readiness must count name evidence.

Reproduction: live student "Khaled Mohamed" has 22 self-reported skills (ids
1-104) but his ESCO target role "ICT security manager" (role 27) requires 20
ESCO phrase skills (ids 105-124) with ZERO id overlap. The old engine matched
only by skill id, so every requirement was "missing" -> ring 0.0% and a gap map
of "0 strong · 0 gap · 20 missing" that ignored obvious self-reported overlap
(Cybersecurity Advanced, Network Security, Threat Detection, SIEM, ...).

The fix adds NAME evidence to ``matching``:
  - normalised-name equality             -> exact evidence (strong/gap by level)
  - token/containment overlap            -> adjacent evidence (always gap, half credit)
Exact-id semantics are unchanged so catalog roles and existing tests are intact.
