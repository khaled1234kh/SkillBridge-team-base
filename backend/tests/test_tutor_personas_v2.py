"""Smart Tutor Personas v2 — Phase 1: general intelligence + real persona identity.

Deterministic (keyless) coverage for:
- each persona's name identity, correct specialty and NO identity leakage across
  the four personas (system prompt and keyless reply both);
- general intelligence routing: science / programming / math questions are
  answered, and unrelated general knowledge is never forced into the student's
  target career;
- trust: personal skill claims, Verified Skills and assessment results are
  never invented, and target-role answers come ONLY from the trusted backend
  context that was passed in;
- persona switching: the selected tutor's identity wins in the system prompt.
- language: the identity question works in English and Arabic.

Never calls a paid API.
